# Overview
This analysis was to determine whether or not the 5 star reviews submitted through the Vine programmed were positively biased compared to reviews made outside of the vine program.

![results screenshot](https://github.com/dylanvowell/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-04-14%20140036.png?raw=true)
- There were a total of 94 vine reviews and 40,471 non-paid reviews tallied
- There were a total of 48 paid 5-star reviews and 15,663 non-paid reviews
- The percentage of 5 star vine reviews is ~ 51% and the percentage of non-paid 5 star reviews is ~39%

## Summary
Due to the sheer discrepancy in number of paid vs unpaid reviews, I don't think it's possible to come to an accurate decision on whether or not there was any bias present. However, if a determination must be made, then it does appear that there is a slight bias towards paid reviews being a higher star rating on average than the unpaid reviews. I suspect that an additional analysis of one or more datasets using the same methods would help determine actual bias accross all review types - paid or unpaid.
